# Mirrorshades

Mirrorshades is a hardware & software platform which allows its user to observe & move around their Real World (RW) environment whilst wearing a wide field of view (FOV), stereoscopic 3D, Head Mounted Display (HMD) which allows them to alternatively view a Virtual Reality (VR) environment from the equivalent vantage point. This is achieved by combination of a head-tracking HMD, webcams, an indoor positioning system (IPS) & a 3D game engine, into a mobile parallel reality interface.

Mirrorshades is a Unity application that combines an Oculus Rift DK1 with the IndoorAtlas indoor positiong system. For the IndoorAtlas integration (see here)[https://github.com/CJ-Davies/IndoorAtlas_SQL_uploader] & for the 3D printed camera clips [see here](https://github.com/CJ-Davies/Oculus-Rift-DK1-camera-mounts). 
For more information on the Mirrorshades project, including photos & videos of it in action, take a look at [the blog posts here](http://cjdavies.org/?cat=136).
