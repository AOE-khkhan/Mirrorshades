Mirrorshades
============

Mirrorshades is a hardware & software platform which allows its user to observe & move around their Real World (RW) environment whilst wearing a wide field of view (FOV), stereoscopic 3D, Head Mounted Display (HMD) which allows them to alternatively view a Virtual Reality (VR) environment from the equivalent vantage point. This is achieved by combination of a head-tracking HMD, webcams, an indoor positioning system (IPS) & a 3D game engine, into a mobile cross reality (XR) interface.
